### Pamela (Pamm) Santana (she/her) ðŸ˜„

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a PostDoc Researcher at SpACE group (Speciation, Adaptation and Co-Evolution) at Lund University.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m deeply interested in how ecological interactions shapes the traits that species presents and an entusiast of Quantitative Ecology and Quantitative Evolutionary Genetics. For that, I use machine learning and data science tools to solve ecological problems, with a sustained interest for network ecology and the prediction of species interactions.
